# SQL Database Project

## Project Description
This repository contains SQL scripts for creating and managing a relational database. The project includes scripts to create the database, define tables, and modify existing tables to ensure data integrity and normalization. It is designed as an educational resource to learn and demonstrate foundational skills in database design and SQL programming.

## Project Structure
- `1_create_database.sql` : Script to create the initial database.
- `2_create_tables.sql` : Scripts to create tables with primary and foreign key constraints.
- `3_modify_tables.sql` : Scripts to modify and update table structures for optimization.

## Features
- Creation of a structured relational database from scratch.
- Table definitions with proper relationships and constraints.
- Schema modification scripts to refine database design.

## How to Use
1. Run `1_create_database.sql` to create the database.
2. Execute `2_create_tables.sql` to create the tables.
3. Use `3_modify_tables.sql` to apply further modifications to the schema.

Make sure you have a SQL database management system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server set up to run these scripts.

## Future Enhancements
- Add sample data insertion scripts.
- Develop stored procedures and triggers for automated tasks.
- Incorporate advanced indexing and performance optimizations.
